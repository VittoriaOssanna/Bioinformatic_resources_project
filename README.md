# Bioinformatic_resources_project
In this repository I report the code and the assignment of the project of the course "Bioinformatic Resources", held by prof. Romanel in a.a. 2022/2023. 

The main file for the project is `Liver_project.Rmd`. In order to run this file, please consider putting every file of the repository in the dame working directory. 
Files aside from `Liver_project.Rmd` and `Liver_hepatocellular_carcinoma.RData` are not necessary, but buy default they are included into the script to speed up the comutation. 

You can find the text of the assignment in `Project_Bioinformatics_Resources_2023.pdf`.
